//1.	A method without a body (no implementation) is known as abstract method.
//2.	A method must always be declared in an abstract class, or we can say that if a class has an abstract method, it should be declared abstract as well.
//3.	If a regular class extends an abstract class, then the class must have to implement all the abstract methods of the abstract parent class or it has to be declared abstract as well.
//4.	Abstract methods in an abstract class are meant to be overridden in derived concrete classes otherwise compile time error will be thrown.
//5.	Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, which means we canâ€™t create an object of an Abstract class.
