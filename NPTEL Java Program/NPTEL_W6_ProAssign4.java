/*
A simple class that demonstrates using the 'synchronized'
keyword so that multiple threads may send it messages.
The class stores two ints, a and b; sum() returns
their sum, and inc() increments both numbers.
<p>
The sum() and incr() methods form a "critical section" --
they can compute the wrong thing if run by multiple threads
at the same time. The sum() and inc() methods are declared
"synchronized" -- they respect the lock in the receiver object.
